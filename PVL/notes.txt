a utility function:

u_k(t) = [x(t)]^a if x(t)>0 and -w|x(t)|^a otherwise

where x(t) is the reward of the trial and k was the chosen lever

e_k(t) = e_k(t-1)+a[u_k(t)-e_k(t)]

e_k is the expected utility for the kth lever, this is updated by its
difference from the actual utility.

p(k) = exp(theta e_k) / bigZ

where bigZ = sum exp(theta e_k)

and theta is parameterized by c with theta = 3^c-1
